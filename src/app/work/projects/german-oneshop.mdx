## Overview

Vodafone webshop offering mobile connectivity, internet, fixed-line services, and devices like phones, tablets, and accessories. Platform specifically designed for Small and Medium Enterprises, with tailored pricing, solutions, and contract options that meet their unique business needs.

## My Impact on the Project

For the past six months, Iâ€™ve played a key role in developing and improving our contract renewal process for clients. This improvement has significantly boosted customer retention and made our internal operations much more efficient.

## Challenges

- **Market Demands**: We constantly adapt to stay competitive as the market and our competitors evolve. As a webshop focused on driving digital sales, we need to be agile and responsive to changing customer expectations.
- **Technical Architecture**: The complex nature of our business requires sophisticated system integration. While synchronization between different components can be challenging, we've consistently delivered great features that work seamlessly together.
- **Cross-Team Coordination**: We're constantly connecting with APIs from various business areas, which means we're always collaborating with different system teams. This coordination is essential for maintaining smooth operations across the platform.
- **Digital Innovation**: We're actively exploring new ways to expand what users can do on our webshop. This involves implementing complete end-to-end workflows using our current technical toolkit, always looking for opportunities to improve the user experience.
- **Component Library Development**: Our team is contributing to a larger initiative to create the newest version of Vodafone's component library. This work helps ensure consistency and efficiency across all our digital products.
