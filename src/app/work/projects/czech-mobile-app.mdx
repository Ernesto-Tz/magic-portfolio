## Overview

This initiative is designed for clients who are moving from regular customer status to small business owners. Our app makes that transition smoother by improving the overall user experience and giving us the ability to offer deals and services that are a better fit for each client’s current needs.

## My Impact on the Project

The biggest challenge during the first stage of the project was understanding the current technical limitations and how to effectively leverage them in our product. To tackle this, our squad held several brainstorming sessions to explore ideas and solutions. In the second phase, I focused primarily on coding the application and bringing our plans to life.

## Challenges

- **Technical limitations**: As this was an innovative initiative, we frequently had to think creatively to overcome technical roadblocks, such as databases not being ready for our requests or data schemas not aligning with client requirements.
- **Dual live Applications**: We delivered the new application code alongside the existing platform for regular customers, which added complexity. Navigating this challenge required strong communication and seamless coordination across teams.
- **Resources Allocation**: At one stage, the project demanded additional support from other services that were already operating at full capacity. We addressed this by initiating negotiation meetings to prioritize tasks and accelerate the application’s launch.
